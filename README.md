# Python Codes (EN)

This repository contains 10 Python programs made in my freshman year at the _Universidade Federal de Uberlândia_ (Federal University of Uberlândia).
Each code solves 1 out of 10 problems given to us students.

PS.: The code was mainly written in Portuguese.

- `aritmetica.py`: Basic operations with 2 numbers given by user.
- `conversao-tempo.py`: Breaks down _n_ seconds into days, hours, minutes and seconds.
- `jogo-avatar.py`: _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ game about elemental manipulation training. The user constantly informs an element and attributes a value
to it. The opposing element's value is then lowered by half the given value. The opposing relationships within elements are **FIRE** &harr; **WATER** and **EARTH** &harr; **AIR**. When done playing, the user can input _X_ as the element and the final values are displayed.
- `vacinacao.py`: A program about COVID-19 vaccine management. The user is first prompted an amount of months. They are then prompted every month about the quantity of vaccines in each monthly supply. Each supply has its vaccines given out to citizens according to priority. At the end of the program, the user is informed about **the amount of people given both doses**, **the amount of people only given the 1st dose**, **the amount of people given an overdue 2nd dose** and **the amount of people awaiting an overdue 2nd dose**. The priority is (_highest_ to _lowest_):
    1. Citizens awaiting an overdue 2nd dose.
    2. Citizens awaiting an on-time 2nd dose.
    3. Citizens not yet vaccinated.
- `porteiro-castelo.py`: A _Rá-Tim-Bum_ (Brazilian TV series) themed program. The user is prompted a password to enter a castle. The password is comprised of numbers and is then evaluated whether it can be sorted in ascending order by "rotating" it or not. The "rotation" means, e.g., turning _a b c d e_ into _b c d e a_. If the sequence can be sorted this way, the castle gatekeeper opens the castle gates. If not, it is then said to be invalid.
- `problema-mochila.py`: A simplified version of the infamous _Knapsack Problem_. The user is supposed to be soon going on a trip and is packing a knapsack. The user first informs the capacity of the knapsack and the number of objets they intend to take to the trip. The user then inputs a sequence of weights of each object and another sequence of respective arbitrary values. After that, the code fills the knapsack with the most-valuable-by-weight items and finally prints the knapsack's total value and weight.
- `sentido-vida.py`: A code about DNA and complementary base pairing. The user is prompted a DNA string and a primer, both written as nitrogenous bases. The code then displays the locations in the DNA string where the primer can be paired with. If there are no locations, the program outputs a _no pairing locations_ message.
- `similaridade-maxima.py`: A game about similarity. The player inputs an _n_ number and right after an _n x n_ matrix row by row as sequences of 0s and 1s. 0s mean empty squares, whereas 1s represent filled squares.
